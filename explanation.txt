My initial thoughts after reading this problem were
to structure this grid system with a 2D-array given the 
initial X, Y input of the northeast corner. Also, I must 
also have to keep track of the direction at which the rover
is facing. I'm thinking of possibly just initializing this 
as a variable signaling North, then reassigning this variable
as needed. If the current direction is L or R then the rover
will move up or down the 'row', otherwise it will move up or
down the 'column'.

- I will have to ask for user input accepting northeast corner
- I will have to ask for user input accepting a string of letters

Thoughts continued:
    - I had to consider the edge cases of when the rover is at 
    the bounds of the grid.
    

-Assumptions
    - Entered rover coordinates lie within the grid.
    - Entered parameters are formatted as expected.
